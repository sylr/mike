mike-dev-guidelines - mike's development guidelines

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Mike's development guidelines.

Workflow
--------
Mike use 'git' for 'source code management' because of its distributed design and
its numerous features. In order to fully benefit of the distributed design mike development
uses a simplified version of the 'Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow'.
(See : http://progit.org/book/ch5-1.html#dictator_and_lieutenants_workflow) This
way of working allows to spread general knowledge of the project across developers.

Here a sequence diagram of the workflow :

--------------------

 * *Hack*   : Work, commit
 * *Acked*  : Acknowledged, means that developer signs with his blood that he has
              reviewed the code and he is ok with it
 * *Nack*   : Not Acknowledged, means that the developer is not ok with the work
              sent and would like some modifications to be done
 * *push*   : Send / propagate a local branch to a remote repository
 * *pull*   : Retrieve locally the content of a remote branch
 * *origin* : The project maintainer public repository

Sending Patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source,shell]
--------------------------
sylvain@kheops:~/git/mike[master]$ rm -rf *.patch
sylvain@kheops:~/git/mike[master]$ git format-patch --cover-letter HEAD~2
0000-cover-letter.patch
0001-views-add-__pg_tables-view.patch
0002-contrib-change-bk-behavior.patch
sylvain@kheops:~/git/mike[master]$ vim 0000-cover-letter.patch
... edit cover letter
sylvain@kheops:~/git/mike[master]$ git send-email --to <mailing-list@abstraction.fr> *.patch
--------------------------

Coding Rules
------------
Mike's coding rules are pretty obvious when reading code but here the main list of
rules that should be respected:

 * '4 spaces' indentation (except for Makefiles which require tabs)
 * All lines 'right trimed'

TIP: The 'contrib/git-hooks/pre-commit' hooks allows to detect spaces at EOL. Copy
     it inside your '.git/hooks' directory.

 * Assignation block vertically aligned
 * 'PLPGSQL' over 'PLPerl' over 'PLPython'
 * 'Perl' over 'Python'
 * All commits must be 'Signed-off'

TIP: The 'contrib/git-hooks/commit-msg' hook will warn you if you forgot to add
     the Signed-off-by line. Copy it inside your '.git/hooks' directory.

 * '\n' only, no '\r\n'
 * No space before and one space after commas, e.g.: 'foo(bar, baz)' , not 'foo(bar , baz)'
 * No space after / before parenthesis / brackets, e.g.: 'foo(bar)' not 'foo( bar )'
 * Successive empty lines must be squashed as one
