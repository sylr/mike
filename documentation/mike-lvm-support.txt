NAME
----
mike-lvm-support - mike's lvm support

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The 'LVM Support' for mike allow to share users' data across multiple smaller tables
of the same kind instead of having all users' data in the same set of unique tables
in order to reduce the amount of time spent to search user data.

This feature is currently 'experimental' as it does not perform well due to some
PostgreSQL limitation that prevent the use of contraint exclusion when an array
used in a WHERE clause is greater than 100 elements, the elements here being users
identifier. This limit can be removed by increasing the MAX_SAOP_ARRAY_SIZE define
in 'src/backend/optimizer/util/predtest.c' but that is not recommended.

A 'logical volume', 'lv', is composed of 'three tables' directory_<lv>, file_<lv> and
as_file_xfile_<lv> which 'inherit' directory, file and as_file_xfile. Each user is
linked to one lv allowing the application to search its data into a particular lv.

The users lv is chosen at the creation of the user with the 'adduser' function.
However, it is possible to migrate a user from one lv to another using the '__lvmvuser'
function in order to balance the amount of data and / or the load of lvs.
