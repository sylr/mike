NAME
----
mike-lvm-support - mike's lvm support

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The 'LVM Support' for mike allow to share users' data accross multiple smaller tables
of the same kind instead of having all users' data in the same set of unique tables
in order to reduce the amount of time spent to search user data.

A 'logical volume', 'lv', is composed of 'three tables' directory_<lv>, file_<lv> and
as_file_xfile_<lv> which 'inherit' directory, file and as_file_xfile. Each user is
linked to one lv allowing the application to search its data into a particular lv.

The users lv is chosen at the creation of the user with the 'adduser' function.
However, it is possible to migrate a user from one lv to another using the '__lvmvuser'
function in order to balance the amount of data and / or the load of lvs.
