DESCRIPTION
-----------
Mike is a `Virtual File System` which primary goals are to be lightweight, robust
and efficient. In a few words Mike is a `PostgreSQL database` which comes with a
`sql API`. The API provides a set of functions needed to manipulate the data into
the database.

The main idea when Mike has been designed was that a file system is accessed, browsed
most of the time, but rarely modified. Knowing that, Mike stores for each inodes
metadata which are recalculated only when the file system is modified in order to
make browsing the fastest possible because all the data fetched are stored, not calculated.
